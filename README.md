# Sunicorn - A simple HTML slideshow library built with Vuejs.

> Thanks to [VueJs](https://vuejs.org) - a great JS Framework.

This library uses [Animate.css](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css) for slide's show and hide animation. So make sure that you had included this library in your HTML `<head>` tag.
